ELISSA: 
This application is a fully responsive, CRUD application in which a user can create, read, update, and delete recipes. Artboards 4-7, found in the provided Adobe XD prototype, correspond with the CRUD part of the application. Users can add a recipe to the local storage database by filling out the form on the Create Recipe page. Then, the user can view the added recipe on the Your Recipes page. Third, a user can further view details of the recipe by clicking a “View” button found on the Your Recipes page which leads them to a View Single Recipe page. The user also has the option to edit the recipe or delete it from the Your Recipes page or the user can edit the recipe for the View Recipe page. Once a user edits a recipe, they can save the recipe so that it updates on the screen and in the database. As the user completes these various actions, they will receive user feedback through Sweet Alerts. 

For this application, I was responsible for building artboards 4-7. These boards include the Create Recipe, Your Recipes, Edit Recipe, and View Recipe pages. By being responsible for these 4 pages, I was also in charge of all styling, responsiveness, and functionality involved. Therefore, I was responsible for the CRUD functionality of the application. I was also responsible for the navigation, mobile navigation, setting up Recipes in local storage, and changing the username/navigation content once a user logs in. All of my pages are responsive at 1280px, 768px, and 360px width.

JULIUS: 

For this application I was responsible for creating and styling the Home, Browse, and Login pages as well as the footer. By being in charge of the login page that means I am also responsible for creating sign up and login functions as well as giving user feedback if things go wrong as they use the page. 

The login function is not fully functional, however all pages I worked on have CSS styling.
Browse and login pages are not responsive at smaller sizes.
